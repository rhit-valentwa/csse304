# CSSE304

This repository contains content for Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology's CSSE304: Programming Language Concepts.

This course presents an implementation approach to the study of programming language concepts. Rather than looking at several programming language features "from the outside" (only a user's perspective), we will instead get an inside view by implementing many of the features ourselves, via a series of interpreters (the languages we write will mostly be subsets of Racket). We will use the Racket programming language to provide a laboratory environment for writing interpreters and illustrating various programming paradigms and concepts.

We **strongly** encourage cloning this repository and pulling it whenever the content is updated. Please do not fork this repository and push your homework solutions to it. This would post all of your solutions publicly online and constitute **academic misconduct**. We do check this, don't do it. 

TLDR: Privately clone the repository, **never** fork the repository, and push your solutions.
